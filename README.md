Using Python to replicate the key figures of a paper titled 'Orthogonality in Principal Component Analysis Allows the Discovery of Lipids in the Jejunum That Are Independent of Ad Libitum Feeding' (PMID: 36144270). Figures 2, 3, and 4 were replicated. The original paper used R packages, but for replicating these figures, Python was used instead.
